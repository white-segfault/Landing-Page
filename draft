Some random scrap working Q/A by myself
- for sec3, a div centered v+h direct
- should we set length for the paragraph div?
If default layout (justify content, align content center) sets up good layout,
then probably don't need
- for 2nd item just add margin
- will jumping to next line work in the paragraph?
- probs need to test it out
works.

- how to handle the quote, align end is too dodgy if set to full screen.
try align center then go from there? (set margin)

- different between margin and padding?
probs need padding instead of margin, since no more elements to separate

still kinda confused how it works.
- adding padding on a parent container -> there is space between first element of box
and top of container, bottom element of box and bottom of container, left/right res
pectively.

key is that words are also elements in terms of flex items

- confused with why button expands
probs the stretch for flex item
